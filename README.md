# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** eliminates a lot of the up front setup, to quickly make a blog viewable at <https://username.github.io>. [Jekyll-Now quickstart](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start)
