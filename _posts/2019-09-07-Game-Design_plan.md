Designing a Visual Novel is complex. There are lots of places you could start from. I think a good start point is the goal of the story, and then the mechanics that will drive the story.

The game I am trying to design is about **friendship dynamics**. I vaguely remember a movie in which a scene seems to repeat itself, of the friends comming together at a party over many years and the friendship changing as they get to know each other's point of view. 



### The core game machanic ###

There are a lot of ways you could gamify the friendship. I brain stormed a few ideas and then fleshed out three ideas.

1. Friends for Life - a long term relationship over years.
2. Setting up friends - depending on situation events will happen.
3. The Fox, Hen and Grain - rules for which characters can be together.



## 1. Friends for Life ##

At first maybe, I thought the game could base around a some of the group of friends comming together at key events, have a brief conversation they then think about an absent member of the group. That leads you to make a choice about the absent member.

* Two friends A & B are together about to leave for University
* They think about one of the other 2 members of the group (C or D).
* You select to think about C.
* You then get to choose the major C chooses at Univesity.
* The story moves to the next phase, where C and A meetup by chance at Christmas.
* They discuss the first year at University, and then think about what B or D is doing.
* You select to think about D.
* Then get to make a choice of what D will do for Christmas, and so the story interates.

It would be a big complex game. That tells the development of the friends over 10 or 12 years. Some choices would lead you to not meet up with another member of the group for years, whilst others may have just a small step of time.
I like the idea of this life-long friendship dynamic game, because it is similar to how my friends and I from High School are. Some choices would cause closeness of friends (move into sharehouse together), whilst others would cause the group to fracture more and more (ie. choosing to move away overseas).



## 2. Setting up Friends ##

The second mechanic idea, could be a night where all the friends are together. You have to make decisions for the group that causes the dynamic to change.
The game would progress through the night, and depending on the dynamic things would happen. I.e:

* A girl would be attracted to A if he is being supported by friends, or 
* if you choose to support B she would be attracted to B. 
* Maybe C would get drunk if A gets the girl, but 
* if B gets the girl then A will fight C.

This game could be controlled sort of like a simulator. Making it replayable, and depending on the story it could be controlled in scope.



## 3. The Fox, Hen, Grain dynamic ##

Then I thought maybe we could keep the dynamic very simple. Make the game a horror game, with only 3 locations. You are a character, and you need to do some tasks and recruit the help of one of the other 3 characters.

* If you leave the Fox character with the Hen, then the Hen dies. 

* Or the Hen with the grain, the Grain dies.

* _This dynamic_ will be hidden from the player, instead the killing seems to be done by a monster, or the darkness.

* _Maybe_ this could get more complex by adding a serries of events, where the characters change roles, or having a more complex problem with 5 or more characters.

I liked this idea, because then it makes more of a reason for the game to have limited locations and to be looping. **The story:** could start at the end, so you know all 4 of your get out alive. Then if a character dies, the story needs to start from the top again (or from the last phase). 

Instead of death, maybe the characters could get into a very very big fight (that was simmering, so as to warn the player not to leave 2 angry players together), or a hospital visit, drug overdose or some other [adult fear](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear).



### Drawing the story path ###

With a game mechanic in mind, you can figure out how to flesh out the story a bit easier. As you thought of your dynamic you were likely thinking of a case or two where the dynamic would work in the game. A diagram is best for this.

![game decision tree](../images/game-layout.png)

I sketched out the decisions of the 3 character dynamic. There are 5 states before a decision:

1. Fox and Grain on one side, _Hen_ on other.
2. _Hen_ and Grain on one side, Fox on other.
3. _Hen_ and Fox on start side, Grain on other.
4. Hen on start side, **Fox** and Grain on other.
5. Hen and _Grain_ on start side, Fox on other. (what is special because you make a step in the wrong direction to get to it)

So from the map I can now plan for the lables, jumps and decisions the player will have. It also gives an opportunity to split the game into phases, or add another mechanic into the mix, to get the required story.

With this, I can now make up sticky notes, or have documents to flesh out theparts of the story, and see the relationship between the steps.

> Similarly,

> with the 3 character columns, then map the story branches,
> or for Idea 2, you could use a flow chart and state tables 
> to map the conditions and steps to set them up.

I have expanded upon the [Friends for Life idea](https://t3liph0n3.github.io/Game-Design_idea-How's_Old_Mate/) in another blog post.

### Next ... ###

Armed with a sticky note or document for each step of the story, and knowing where it relates in the whole scheme of things. You can now write a draft of the text for each section.

There are many ways to flesh out the story now. 
* You could start with a one sentence section summary, then repeat expanding on the summary until you get a good chunky story. 

* For each section jot down the motivation for each character, scene, conflict etc. Then fill in the blanks to get some prose.

* read lots of [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.com/), and subvert, lampshade or  borrow tropes to fill in the story.
