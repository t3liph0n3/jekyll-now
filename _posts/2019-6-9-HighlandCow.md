title: Cow Print
---

At 8:00am today I went to Bunnings to purchase some bark-chips for the garden, and a also got a framed $10 print of a Highland Cow. It had been 10 or so months since I moved into this appartment, and basically we haven't decorated other than setting some garden beds on the balcony and changing the shower heads. There are many little tasks, like painting scuffed or damaged walls, maybe setting some hooks or shelving that I would like to do, but my wife doesn't want to waste the money. The cow print would be nice to start decorating the study or lounge room wall.

I also purchased a baby carrier (one of those things that holds a baby on your stomach) and when I got home my upstairs neighbours were just arriving home. So I said hello and asked them about their child etc. The talk lead to them offering us their bassinet. We already have a cot, but it is the start of building a good network for raising our kid. 

I should probably try and write this essay for my engineering certificate, or do something productive. But also I just want to enjoy the weekend.
