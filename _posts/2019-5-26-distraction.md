I found an online degree in [applied science (architecture)](https://www.open.edu.au/degrees/bachelor-of-applied-science-architectural-science-curtin-university-cur-bas-deg) and it sparked my imagination. I remember at High School I liked technical drawing and wanted to studying an engineering course in year 12, but with not enough students it was cancelled.
Getting into architecture felt too hard, it required a high score and maybe a portfolio or something... so I just dreamed about it. In TV shows I like there is often an architect, most recently [The Pier](https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/program/the-pier). I like the idea of architecture, but...

I think this course is just a $30,000 7 year (or how ever long it will take me) dream. Similar to when I purchase a backpack and then don't go hiking or camping, or the hundreds of dollars of Dungeons and Dragons books and stuff I purchased through my teens and twenties and never played.

Somethings - like snowboarding, I started out hiring gear and found I enjoyed it in a weay I didn't expect. I hope paying $350 for the sailing course in August will be similar, teach me a skill that will give me excitement and reward.

All of this is probably pointing to how in general I need to make more plans, and have goals and focus.
