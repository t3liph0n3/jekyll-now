Yesterday I was looking for a ReactJS API and found https://openlayers.org/workshop/en/

I did the workshop for Vector data, it is a little interesting. At first I did not know how to follow the steps, but eventually figured out each section is just adding a new capability to my map.

At the step Drag-and-Drop I at first thought I had failed, until I learnt I had to drop a .json file into the page.

Now I have to learn about deploying, as I haven't deployed anything yet.
Then think up a cool/fun/intersting ReactJS app to make.
