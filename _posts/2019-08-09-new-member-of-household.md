## Recently we had a new addition to my family

For the past few months they were literally kicking around inside by wife. A very active fetus, for most of the second and third trimester until the Estimated Due Date.

On the calculated 40th week, there movements slowed down a lot. It caused a little bit of concern, so we visited the hospital. At hopsital my wife was hooked up to some machines that showed fetus was healthy, but to be sure we had an induction booked for the following week and a pre-induction scan planned.
It took a day or two to book the scan. But the results from the scan were worrying, they were too big, and so we stayed at hospital to talk to some specialists and then have the induction that afternoon.

The midwife at the induction suite that night tried to convince us nothing would happen overnight, that usually it takes many hours to get things started. But an hour or two after applying the cream  my wife was in labour. I still went home, thinking it would take a while, but was called back at 2am as my wife was moving to a birthing suite, ready to deliver. I arrived just as the epidural was being readied. Everything quietened down for the next few hours, my wife progressed very fast, as I napped in the conrer. 
Before sunrise the labour was going well, but our new family member wasn't moving down to the delivery spot. So at the morning change of shift we went into surgery to deliver our firstborn.

The talks about the surgery were very serious and hushed. Everybody on the team were alert while we were a little tired and worried. There was a short delay in getting into the theatre, so the epidural wore off a little bit causing my wife a bit of pain. But once in it theatre everything seemed to go so fast as I held her hand.

Our new member was delivered, put into the machine to be weighed, got two nappy changes (as they peed on the nurse) and was confirmed to be a big baby a little over 4kg.
