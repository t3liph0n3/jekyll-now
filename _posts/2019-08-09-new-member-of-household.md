## Recently we had a new addition to my family

They were a very active fetus, kicking a lot in the womb until the Estimated Due Date.
On the calculated 40th week, little fetus' movements slowed down and caused a little bit of concern, so we visited the hospital. At hopsital my wife was hooked up to some machines that showed fetus was healthy, but had an induction booked for the following week and a pre-induction scan planned.
It took a day or two to book the scan. But the results from the scan were terrible, the fetus was too big, and so we stayed at hospital to have the induction that afternoon.

The midwife at the induction suite that night tried to convince us nothing would happen overnight, that usually it takes many hours to get things started. But an hour or two after applying the cream  my wife was in labour. I went home, thinking it would still take a while, but was called back at 2am as she went into a birthing suite. I arrived just as the epidural was being readied. It was a tough night, my wife progressed very fast, as I napped in the conrer. 
Before sunrise the labour was going well, but little fetus wasn't moving down to the delivery spot. So at the morning change of shift we went into surgery to deliver our firstborn.
