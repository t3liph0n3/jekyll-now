### Recently
All week it felt like I was doing no work. I wanted to write my essay for my engineering certificate, but I got side-tracekd and sucked deeper into understanding the maintenance policy at work.
Then on Friday I discovered that in the 1960s **Preventative Maintenance (PM)** was disproved, and it resulted in huge savings and allowed systems like the Boing 747 to be economical and safer.

On Friday I went to Ikea, purchased a Cot for the soon ariving new member of my family, and Saturday was the election.

### Sailing
This weekend I also purchased a sailing lesson set - [Start Crewing & Helming](https://www.discoversailing.org.au/course/keelboatcourse/) at South of Perth Yacht Club, in August.

So I have been watching a few youtube videos like [lean2sail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgmoJRXPUJQ) as well as dreaming watching cruising vloggers:
* [MJ Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/user/jjohnson0882)
* [Venture life sailing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gvcW3y2LBs)
* [Sailing Ruby Rose](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rRsBE2nFbnUSjtmv6Jq6w)
and other couples and families that are sailing around here and there.
