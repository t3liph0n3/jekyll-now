Today I measured my blood glucose level first thing and it was high - **6.2**. A few days ago it was 5.7.

I ate a BigMac from McDonalds for lunch, but for dinner I ate 2 sausages and a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and capsicum (no dressing). After dinner I went for a 3km jog in 18 minutes. Then showered and weighed myself, **84.4kg**.

> my BMI is **27.56**

according to [bmi calc. aus](https://bmicalculatoraustralia.com) it is the average (the aussie average is 27.6).

I measured my blood glucous again around 9pm, 2 hours after dinner (and an hour after the run) it was 5.3mmol/L. So maybe my morning high glucous is nothing to worry about?

The reason I went for a run,  was because I was thinking about doing a half marathon (21km) at the Perth Running festival in October. That stemmed from PT on Tuesday where I asked about running. So today I looked up some tips for training for a half marathon, and it suggested having a 12 week program and then I noticed a hashtag #RWRunStreak about running 1 mile a day. After sitting around all day, driving and doing work at a desk I felt I needed to burn energy.

Maybe I should make a solid goal to get my BMI below 25 (loose 10kg), and run at least 16km a week. Or go all out and run a half marathon in October?
