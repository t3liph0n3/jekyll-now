Today I measured my blood glucose level first thing and it was high - **6.2**. A few days ago it was 5.7.

I ate a BigMac from McDonalds for lunch, but for dinner I ate 2 sausages and a salad of tomato, lettuce, cucumber and capsicum (no dressing). After dinner I went for a 3km jog in 18 minutes. Then showered and weighed myself, **84.4kg**.

> my BMI is **27.56**

according to [bmi calc. aus](https://bmicalculatoraustralia.com) it is the average (the aussie average is 27.6).

I measured my blood glucous again at 9pm, 2 hours after dinner (and an hour after the run) it was xxx.
