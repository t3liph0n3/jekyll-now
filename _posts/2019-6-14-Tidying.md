Today I cooked a trout, baked potatoes and carrots and boiled some corn and brocolini for dinner. After watching some videos online, I got to a video about decluttering, and decided to sort out two draws in the kitchen. I fixed the handle on the second bottom draw too.

I need to figure out a way to tidy up my wife's things. She has luggage that is falling to pieces, boxes of clothes that she never wears and piles and piles of receipts and scraps of paper that look like garbage. When I brought home the print of a cow last weekend she did say she disliked it, maybe I could make a deal to remove the print if she tidies up?

There is also my mother in law, she leaves all the bottles and packets on the bench after cooking rather than put them away. It is a little ironic because she sorted through my wardrobe when she first arrived a few month ago.

So now I am watching more videos, just relaxing after a productive week at work. Trying to keep in the back of my mind habits I should pick-up to make next financial year better than this year...
