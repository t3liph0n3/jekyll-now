Where do game ideas come from?
According to the [Inform Designer's Manual](http://inform-fiction.org/manual/) Graham Nelson wandered a library and phocopied pages at random to start designing [Jigsaw](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=28uhmejlntcbccqm).

Often I find explinations for the inspiration for sureal games like [Adam Cadre's Photopia](http://adamcadre.ac/content/phaq.txt). Where he explains the ideas for a few puzzles and how the game centres around a sequence of colours. In a sureal game it is a little easier to stitch together random seeming scenes.

Or guides that end up explaining very little like [tv-tropes So You Want To Make A Visual Novel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/MakeAVisualNovel) that basically explains _You_ can write a Kinetic Novel, or have a VN with Common Route, Long Route, Short Route, Diverging Routes and Final Route. There is a lot of good inspiration from TvTropes.org, but figuring out how it works.

I remember spending hours and days planning Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns. Escentially the process was to think of the worlds limits, and then draw a map, or explain how those limits came to be. Maybe this would lead to desiging a god, or a kingdom. But designing for Dungeons and Dragons and Table Top games has an advantage, because the Game Master / DM is infront of the players and can test, adjust and ad-lib as required to keep the players interest. Making a computer game is harder, because you have limited resources and have to draw the player in to want to play through the story you designed.

## None of these methods of game design instill meaning or storytelling ##

To design a simulation, you can start with a fun idea to let the player test. But to design a computer game (visual novel) you need a story.

In researching for this article I found [Instant Campaign Builder](http://www.dungeonmastering.com/InstantCampaignBuilder.pdf) that explains a system called LOCK:
* **Lead** Flesh out the story, anything that grabs players attention is a good lead (explain why they care).
* **Objective** let the player decide what to do. Plant clues in the establishing scenes to help them decide (DO NOT DECIDE FOR THE PLAYER)
* **Conflict** having set objective, put something to oppose it. Maybe the weather, or the characters, or a NPC.
* **Knockout** end the scene memorably, reward them accordingly.

What sounds a good way to layout a story. But when you are thinking of inspiration maybe the best thing to do is **steal a story**.

## Borrow / Steal a story ##

They say Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but actually borrowing or stealing a story has advantages:

* The player is likely to be familiar with the plot, premise etc.
* The story is proven (has worked in the past)
* You can spend time on the prose or artwork (or other aspect you want)
* If you make the story interactive, the player may already have thought about other endings etc.

There are also thousands of stories, long a short that you can use.
