This is a game with a set of friends. Maybe 4 friends from High School, who catchup at times, creating a story.

Each section of the game has 2 friends catchup, explain what has happened since last meeting and then they think about one of the other friends. The player then gets to make decisions about what the other friend is doing, and progress the game to the next section, where the player and a friend catchup...

## The mechanic ##

There are 4 characters - Blue, Yellow, Green, Red (the primary colours, or sides of an [uckers board](http://www.uckers.co.uk/)).

[![game decision tree draft](../images/game-layout2.png)]

I sketch up the flow of the story in [XMind](https://www.xmind.net), so I can see the scenes and the decisions that get to that scene.

## The scenes ##

From my decision tree I have:

1. Blue and Green - end of school party.
   Blue explains he will be going away, Green explains he will study science.

2. Symposium
   Red and Green meet at a Science Symposium, discuss first semester of school. 

3. Friendly face in town
   Yellow discovers Blue is at the rival Uni in his new town.

4. Red and Yellow - Christmas in July
   Red and Yellow meet at a Christmas in July. Red is looking for a part time job, Yellow going into desert for placement next semester.

5. Online Chat
   Blue and Green chat online, both are thinking of studying more IT. Depending on if Red and Yellow, different options are available for next step.

6. Bookshop (note Red may be Engineering or Science)
   Blue and Red meet at a bookshop, where Red works. Blue has started dating a girl in the physics class.
