Today I just learnt Codepen has [challenges](https://codepen.io/challenges/).

I am listening to a podcast about Codepen, ["breaking things"](https://blog.codepen.io/2019/11/06/243-breaking-stuff/) about software development things that go wrong, having tools like Badger to monitor that the app/page is working.

Then a [commandline heros podcast](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-2/press-start).
That got me thinking, I should focus on making a Renpy game.
### There are 49 days left this year ###

I should plan to make a game.

I started researching fun things for in my game, and found [Konami Code](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=56990&p=519685&hilit=konami+code#p519685)

It doesn't seem to work because A is an auto key for settings. Also I am unsure where it is listening or how to debug.

### Meladaptive Game Design ###
    *   I then started thinking about a game to make.
    *   That lead into some meladaptive dreaming about, "what if when I was at High School it was different" as in "what if rather than watching rubbish TV sitcoms in guidance class, they explained about HSC marks and how to get into Uni." Or "if rather than a friend leaving the school we went to, my family moved and I was the new student for the Senior High School"

* Maybe I could make a Raising-Sim game like Long Live the Queen, where you have to survive the 2 years of Year 11 and 12 - get a good Higher School Certificate mark. Or something similar.
   * study
   * form groups, to collaboratively learn and drive up the class/school HSC marks
   * joing sports team, or after school group
   * get a part time job
   * go on adventures
   * explore super natural happenings in the new city ;) 
* The game will start with the player as the late transfer, just after the first week back into Year 11.
* Maybe it is like [Always Greener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_Greener) with families swapping. Or maybe you only get a spot becasue the other person in the class got pregnant and so you were admitted at the last minute.

* In a similar vein, I could do my 1 year 3 months - the length of time allocated to a pre-university student visa for Japanese language students.
   * study (set goals, of kanji, conversation etc.)
   * get sucked into latest gimmick for learning (Benny - Fluent in 3 months, Heisig )
   * manage your flat/dorm
   * get stuck on social media
   * drop out of language school
   * travel ! (take Shinkansen to exotic places)
   * try meet Japanese people
   * eat out (maybe alone)
   * explore super natural happenings in Tokyo
   * Sit the JLPT
* Then I turn in my study to my Japanese books I haven't read in the past 2 or 3 years and feel sad, that I did spend a year in Japan learning Japanese and got not very far.
* I would have to figure out logically how the character got the cash, it would be fun to be a poor person, who somehow got lucky to get to Japan. [Maybe Mega style](https://megatokyo.com/strip/7) Or get a small inheritence. **Or a redundancy package**
* Maybe, you have just been made redundant at 28/29. You always wanted to study a second language, and browsing the internet you find that it is easy to study in Japan. Sure you started working in the industry at 19, never went to Uni because you didn't have the cash etc. but now with $80k savings (actually this could be more, if you choose different hobbies?) and $50k redundancy package, you are set to fund a year of travel and learning Japanese. You will start with a hit list, of things you want to do. It makes sense too, the gimmick traps etc. Cashed up, most people want your coin.
    * cue the sprites of our main character in hi-vis as they get their redundancy package.
    * workmates (all older) will joke you will "bring home a talking dictionary"/Japanese wife
    * being almost 30 looms as a problem somehow, as does not having a degree. So many peoples suggestions will not be applicable. You need a degree to teach english, being almost 30 a working holiday visa is not going to happen.
    * what will you do with your Japanese super power?
    * When you transition, you need to not look back. 
    * our character could have had some episodes in past, trying to collect comics, or play D&D and not finding a group, or spending lots of cash of crap. As they tidy up their house (they pay too much rent for), they mostly throw everyting out. Pay to send it to the tip.
    * friends are already distant, getting married not thinking about the character, to make him feel more isolated. Ontop of being the youngest at the company.


These two ideas have strict time constraints, but I have to figure out how to make the choices seem logical. If each turn is a week, then how does the choice work. If I choose to study hard this week, does it mean I miss the party?

I thought of the Redundancy game, when driving to pick up my wife. I like it most right now. It is a nice mix, something unique. Sort of tells a bit of my story, but is distinct enough to not be some introverted game.

**BUT** it still needs to have fleshed out the game play, the story is cool. But how it will translate into gameplay, and what is the story from here is what I need to design/plan/think about.
