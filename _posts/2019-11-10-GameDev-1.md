suggests writing out a document, that outlines with 
```
    Characters
        Ask about their backstory, what they believe in, goals etc. so we know what motivates them
 

    Family and close companions
        They influence the characters, coming to terms with your family - learning wrong from right, accepting them or shunning them. Filling this in makes the story less paper thin. Family also includes childhood friends, mentors et. al.
 

    Regional powers, factions, organizations and municipalities
        Regional flavor, which factions are vying for control, what are the histories.

 

    Nations or national factions
        Bigger groups with more detailed and probably longer histories. What is their uniqueness culture/worships/gods/ethics/beliefs
        (many people steal from real life for this, because it is hard)

 

    Global powers
        Entiries that lead the armies of good and evil. Or the bureaucratic weight oppressing the system 
        "Unless the scope of the story is very narrow, it can be all too easy for these powers to overtake the narrative."

 

    Cosmic powers
        "people who won the superhero lottery" They don't always have a large role, but they are indivual and have flaws:jealousy, hubris, wrath, lust, etc. They can also have long histories...

Explains how VNs are different to normal story writting, in that beats like *he said* or *she smiled* are conveyed with sprites, and you script writing only what is said by the characters.

How the **budget** of the story also is limited because you have to get artwork for new characters, scenes etc.

Has a little about Plot or Character VNs.

### Why would you pick plot-based structure: ###

   * If you have many different endings that are consequence of players ACTIONS
   * If you have a fixed personality of main character
   * If your story will feature many story arcs and support characters
   * If the focus of the story is happening after the initial buildup

### Why would you pick a story-based structure: ###

   * If you have different endings that are consequence of playerâ€™s PERSONALITY
   * If you want character to build their personality during the game
   * If you want to preserve neutrality of choices
   * If events that character is going through are the focus of the game
   * If the peak of buildup happens before the branching
