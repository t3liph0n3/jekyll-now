Today I started learning about Sass. And honestly 45minutes in, I think it is a waste of time.
Sass can be done as easily in vanilla CSS it seems.

Reading the [sass-lang.com guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide) it seemed it referenced things like variables, inherritence and mapping as if CSS was impossible to do these things. When infact you can do those things with the same or less ammount of code in CSS than SASS.

I then saw an advert for [sass in 2hrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs), and watching 20-30 minutes it left me thinking it was just a headache to setup SASS when compiling also strips some of the css variability.

Then I watched [why you should precompile css](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hNDzcpWwFM), that showed how you can use SASS for processing as in changing the colour scheme on the fly or something similiar using looping. And that sparked my interest.
> You shouldn't be so out of( the loop that you can not see the benefits in a pre-processor, or not even be able to impliment it
from that quote, I thought back to when I was learning HTML at Highschool and for a long time I thought it was cheating to use website makers like Microsoft Frontpage (or saving word documents as websites) because of the huge amount of waste they generated with extra lines of code and tags that were not required if you wrote the html in a text-editor.
