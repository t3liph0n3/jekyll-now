### Today was a productive Sunday

At 8:00am today I went to Bunnings to purchase some bark-chips for the garden, and a also got a found a $10 framed print of a Highland Cow.
 It had been 10 or so months since I moved into this appartment, and basically we haven't decorated other than setting some garden beds on the balcony and changing the shower heads. There are many little tasks, like painting scuffed or damaged walls, maybe setting some hooks, or shelving; that I would like to do. But my wife doesn't want to waste the money on little projects. The cow print would be nice to start decorating the study or lounge room wall.

I went home and topped up the garden, tidyied up and had some tea all before my wife woke up. What is actually pretty usual because she would sleep all day if she could.

After lunch I drove out and purchased a baby carrier (one of those things that holds a baby on your stomach), and looked around the sporting store. It was raining, so I decided not to go practice golf swings. When I returned home from the store, my upstairs neighbours were just arriving home. So I said hello and asked them about their child etc. The talk lead to them offering us their bassinet. We already have a cot, but it is the start of building a good network for raising our kid. 

They dropped off the basinet and we built it in 10 minutes flat, so it will be probably sitting in the corner of our bedroom for a few weeks until the child is born...
