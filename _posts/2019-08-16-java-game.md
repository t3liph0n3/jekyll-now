Today I made my first github branch. I did some searching and found [git how to](http://githowto.com/creating_a_branch) explains how *git checkout* works. So now rather than having many minor changes to my _master_ branch, I can create branches for adding functions/testing etc. and then merge or quash them.
## Trading Ship Game - changes ##

So I have started editing [TradingShipGame](https://github.com/t3liph0n3/TradingShipGame/tree/gamify) adding things like a loosing condition, and changing the colour scheme.

I should have a plan for more things to edit, but am just making small steps and testing out the game. At the moment it is a bit boring as usually two of the four ports are for buying one thing and two others are only good for selling stuff. There is a 1 in 4 chance the game will be lost on the first move.

## Restarting a html game ##

I scratched my head a bit, until I discovered 
'''
document.location.href = "";
'''
will reload a page. Effectively restarting a one page html game!

## gpg to verify commits

I also used *[gpg](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manpage.en.html)* to verify my github commits :)

It was a little dificult figuring out the process, as [the github help guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification) had so many steps, when I just needed to:

1. *gpg --full-generate-key* then following the steps to make a GPG key
2. *gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG* to check the keyID
3. *git config --global user.signingkey {keyID}* to put the keyID into my git user settings
4. *gpg --armor --export {keyID}* to get the public key block code.
5. _copy and past the *key block* into github settings_ 
6. adding *_-S_* to *git commit...* commands
