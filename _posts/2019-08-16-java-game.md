Today I made my first github branch. I did some searching and found [git how to](http://githowto.com/creating_a_branch) explains how *git checkout* works. So now rather than having many minor changes to my _master_ branch, I can create branches for adding functions/testing etc. and then merge or quash them.
## Trading Ship Game - changes ##

So I have started editing [TradingShipGame](https://github.com/t3liph0n3/TradingShipGame/tree/gamify) adding things like a loosing condition, and changing the colour scheme.

I should have a plan for more things to edit, but am just making small steps and testing out the game. At the moment it is a bit boring as usually two of the four ports are for buying one thing and two others are only good for selling stuff. There is a 1 in 4 chance the game will be lost on the first move.

## Restarting a html game ##

I scratched my head a bit, until I discovered 
'''
document.location.href = "";
'''
will reload a page. Effectively restarting a one page html game!
