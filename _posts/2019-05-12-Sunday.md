### Blocking websites
You can block websites by adding the URL to **/etc/hosts**

```
0.0.0.0	www.news.com.au
```

To edit **/etc/hosts** you need to have permission to edit, what generally means runing the code with *_sudo_*.
 
The above line, causes a request for news.com.au to be directed to 0.0.0.0 - that will return the *unable to connect* warning. 

It is very similar to the *alias* in **bashrc**, so you could use it to redirect something like myblog.com to a static IP for a locally hosted website IP.
