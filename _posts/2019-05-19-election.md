### Recently

All week it felt like I was doing no work. I wanted to write my essay for my engineering certificate, but I got side-tracekd and sucked deeper into understanding the maintenance policy at work.

Then on Friday I discovered that in the 1960s **Preventative Maintenance (PM)** was disproved, and it resulted in huge savings and allowed systems like the Boeing 747 to be economical and safer.

### Ikea
On Friday afternoon I went to Ikea, purchased a Cot for the soon ariving new member of my family. I purchased a few other little things too, and checked with my wife that we would buy the nicer and $40 more expensive matress for the cot.

Last time I went to Ikea, I was annoyed because my wife wanted to buy bedside tables and didn't want to look around. Where as I had wanted to look around and wanted to ask her about the style she wanted for the house. I find it very hard to talk to her about household things, she wants to not think about budgets, or cleaning, or anything. So it leaves me to make decisions and then be told off - for spending too much, or buying a rabbit after a few mentions of wanting a pet.

### Sailing
This weekend I also purchased a sailing lesson set - [Start Crewing & Helming](https://www.discoversailing.org.au/course/keelboatcourse/) at South of Perth Yacht Club, in August.

So I have been watching a few youtube videos like [lean2sail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgmoJRXPUJQ) as well as dreaming watching cruising vloggers:
* [MJ Sailing](https://www.youtube.com/user/jjohnson0882)
* [Venture life sailing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gvcW3y2LBs)
* [Sailing Ruby Rose](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rRsBE2nFbnUSjtmv6Jq6w)

and other couples and families that are sailing around here and there.

There is no chance I would be doing anything more than a weekend race, though who knows - maybe if I like it I could sign my wife up for a sail...
