Today I uploaded the website I built in 2017 to [GitHub](https://github.com/t3liph0n3/Bootstrap-Homepage). I needed to read up and double check I added the correct folders and files to my **.gitignore**, and then I attempted to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to show the dependency on **bootstrap 3.3.7**. I do not think I was successful in the part of using Yarn correctly, it also made my folder that originally had 2 files and a folder now a bit more complex.

That took almost 40 minutes. I know, because today I am using [tomatoTimer](https://tomato-timer.com/) to do my work. Because the baby was still asleep after 25 minutes I just clicked reset and start for my second 25 minutes.
