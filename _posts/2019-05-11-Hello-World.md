I managed to set up a jekyll-now blog here.

You can fork [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub, and follow the instructions to setup your own blog on github pages like this.

The hardest part I found, was renaming the repository *username.github.io*, so this site wasn't at *username.github.io/jekyll-now/* with broken links etc.
