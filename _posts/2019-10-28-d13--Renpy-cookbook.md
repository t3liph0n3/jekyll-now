Renpy-cookbook
Today I had so much other things going on. That I spent 35-40 minutes reading the [Renpy-cookbook](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewforum.php?f=51) to study some algorithms.(
There was a pretty good explination of how to impliment [Affection Points](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=22817).

I then downloaded the Renpy-SDK. Not sure what is does.
On Ubuntu to install renpy I used
>apt-get install renpy
and it is not the latest version that gets installed on anyting... The SDK is a 90MB folder, that I did change my game directory to for one game that was in the SDK, but I still can not use the tutorial or other "pre-loaded" games... 

Too tired to work on...
