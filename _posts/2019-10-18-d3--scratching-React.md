I continued reading through [reactJS/docs' Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html), and writing notes in yesterday's entry.
I then had a look at my old websites I made with my last 100 days of code, and for free-code-camp
![old websites](images/r2d3.png)
* The site on the left uses Bootstrap to have three views and some nice looking progress bars and icons.
* The site on the right has a JS script for generating the calendar that highlights today.
I was thinking about how to render the Bootstrap code into reactJS, and found [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) but then I considered the function I want will be easy to do by managing state in react :)

As I fed my baby at 4pm I searched Youtube and found [Dev-Ed's React tutorial for beginners video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGcsHMXbSOA) what nicely summed up what I had been reading with a demonstration, and clarrified how _curly braces {}_ work.
