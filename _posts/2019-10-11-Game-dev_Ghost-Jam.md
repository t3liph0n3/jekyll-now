title: Game-dev Gentle Ghost Jam
---

I signed up for [Gentle Ghost Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gentle-ghost-jam) a few weeks ago. At the time I was thinking:
* in October I will be on long service leave
* in October I will be taking care of my newborn
* I will have time to develop a [renpy](https://www.renpy.org/) game
* the end of the jam is in line with the half-way point of my long service leave, so I will feel I had acheived somethin

But after my first week stay-at-home-parenting I have no spent any time on this game.

## There is only 20 days until the jam ends! ##

I have only hashed out an idea or two, very broadly. Not done any planning of the story, or how to impliment any gameplay elements.

My child is only a few months old, and sure they sleep a lot, but also they are awake a lot too and need attention. Not to mention the other errands and housework I have been doing, that normally I would do on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but since I am a home sort of get done sporadically. To write this paragraph took over 15 minutes as I had to go calm the child who had stired from the afternoon nap.
