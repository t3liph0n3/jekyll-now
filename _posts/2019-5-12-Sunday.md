### Blocking websites
You can block websites by adding it to **/etc/hosts**
`0.0.0.0	www.news.com.au`
Remember to use **sudo** when opening **/etc/hosts** with your favourite text editor.

This basically causes a request for news.com.au to be directed to 0.0.0.0 and return the *unable to connect* warning.
