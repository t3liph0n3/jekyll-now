Today I focused a little on how to design React pages/apps. I started by reading [ReactJS.com Main Concepts page](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html), then watching a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFEoarLnnqM).

To design a ReactJS page, the suggestion is to start with a plain text render of what you want to achieve. An outline of the DOM as it were, that you then identifify the components within.

Then rewrite the DOM at top level so the components are tags, to divide into components.

Identify the most economical layout of your code (so you do not recalculate stuff, or double up on information). Passing props and using states appropriately, to cut down on handling infomation.
