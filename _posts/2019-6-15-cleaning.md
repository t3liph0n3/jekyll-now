title: Cleaning
---

It is Saturday, today I woke up a bit late and was worried I would get nothing done. But I managed to tidy up the bookshelf, vacuume, go a little KonMari and sort through my wardrobe and clean the ensuite and do a load or two of washing.

In our ensuite we have a roller tray unit thing, I moved my things from the bottom tray to a small tote-tray, and put the basin soap into a dish so there will hopefuly not be lots of soap scum and stains on the benchtop next time I clean.

In tidying up I have got a pile of clothes and small bag of old scrap paper to throw away.

As well as cleaning up, I watched a few too many vlogs:


* [bestdressed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQhwPVwcP-DnbUZtIMrupw) about a young woman who thrift shops, lives in LA and does DIY.
* [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany) a minimalist? who is doing 12 30 days challenges this year, i.e. no coffee, cold showers, 1 hour meditation. He is American and has an Australian wife.
* [Krist Soup](https://www.youtube.com/user/kristinesmiley) a Korean-American girl who has some interesting stories about her youth.
* [Chill With Linh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvvCuDk1uuVxmSD9aU2Ts4Q) a Japanese woman who has stories about work life in Tokyo. Like moving without a moving company.
