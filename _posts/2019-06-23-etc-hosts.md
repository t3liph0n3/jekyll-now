### The battle to block google sites like Youtube
I have edited up my **/etc/hosts** file some more. My goal is to block both websites that I waste time on (youtube), and sites that I do not like the business model of (read: they track you).

My **/etc/hosts** now looks like:

```
127.0.1.1     facebook.com news.com.au www.news.com.au www.facebook.com
127.0.1.1     google.com www.google.com tpc.googlesyndication.com
127.0.1.1     maps.google.com www.google.com/maps/ apis.google.com www.gstatic.com
127.0.1.1    gmail.com account.google.com
127.0.1.1     https://www.youtube.com/
127.0.1.1     www.youtube.com i.ytimg.com
127.0.1.1     quora.com
127.0.1.1     accounts.google.com
```

To block YouTube I needed to block both: 
* youtube.com, and 
* ytimg.com.

Simiarly, for blocking google maps I needed to block*:
* maps.google.com 
* google.com/maps
* pis.google.com, as well as 
* gstatic.com

I am sure there are many other URLs I need to block to stop google products. Becuase they seem to actively try and prevent blocking just one URL. For blocking google maps, I had to update **/etc/hosts/** clear my browser caches and then try to open google maps. I kept doing it until maps no longer opened.

### A friendly alternative to maps.google.com

[OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is an awesome map site, I found it's maps were more up to date than google maps, and it is built on _open data_ and community driven (what is probably why it is more up to date, becasue my local government uses it).

If you are nautically inclined [OpenNauticalChart.org](http://www.opennauticalchart.org/) has open sourced Nautical charts, and there are many other open source and user friendly Geographic Information Systems depending on your requirements.

### duckduckgo.com

An alternative search engine, that in many ways is superior to google is [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) - duckduckgo doesn't try to predict your search, or hide paid results in with real search results. So I find it better for searching the webs.
