Today I preped my Twitter account with scheduled photo uploads for the next few months.
Then after lunch I started writing a game outline for a game I am calling [O-week]. Sort of loosely based on how I didn't plan going to Uni too well.
I imagine it will have a lot of telephoning, so will use the phone-template I downloaded, and be a little sad and about not procrastinating or something...
