I sometimes focus on reading about self improvement or professional development.

This week after a few short weeks of Parental Leave, I am in a professional development phase. Partly because in 6 weeks I will be on leave again, and then changing roles to take on some more responsibility etc.

At first, I stumbled upon [Ship in six](https://shop.stackingthebricks.com/courses/ship-in-six) what is about producing something in 6 weeks. But then I looked up some innovation things and got to reading [Task & Purpose - This Is Why The Best NCOs Self-Develop](https://taskandpurpose.com/tag/self-development). It was an enlightening article. It explains how NCOs need to:
* Read
* Write about your experience
* Pursuit civilian education
* watch TED talks, listen to podcasts for inspiration
* Join a professional association
* Learn a foreign language
* Finish an athletic completion (do more than the fitness test)
* Attend conferences
* Discuss your self-development with others

I know I am in a rut at work, not having made much progress with my task journal to get my Engineering Qualification.

Except for not progressing since my last Engineering course, My career is actually going very well. But, I am a bit of a career cowboy - letting others dictate where I go and do, rather than using the things I know to shape my career. Years ago I read [Design Your Life](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/athletics-physical-education-and-recreation/pe-550-designing-your-life-spring-2009/index.htm) on [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) and it sort of got me dreaming of change, rather than shaping my life. I take opportunities that make my career and life more interesting, i.e. taking a year leave without pay to study in Japan, sticking around office jobs that give me a lot of free time to focus on projects that interest me... a little to the detriment of doing things needed for career advancement.

So over the next day or two I will try and make up a bit of a plan. Today I listed things I could get done in the next week or two, and I need to ask some questions about what I need to also be focusing on to make my next job easier. Maybe I will develop a mud-map, or just have lots more things on a to-do list.
