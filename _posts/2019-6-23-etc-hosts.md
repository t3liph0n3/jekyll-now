I have edited up my /etc/hosts file some more,

> 127.0.1.1 facebook.com news.com.au www.news.com.au www.facebook.com
> 127.0.1.1 google.com www.google.com tpc.googlesyndication.com
> 127.0.1.1 maps.google.com www.google.com/maps/ apis.google.com www.gstatic.com
>  127.0.1.1 gmail.com account.google.com
> 127.0.1.1 https://www.youtube.com/
> 127.0.1.1 www.youtube.com i.ytimg.com
> 127.0.1.1 quora.com
> 127.0.1.1 accounts.google.com

To block YouTube I needed to block both youtube.com and ytimg.com, similarly for blocking google maps I needed to block maps.google.com google.com/maps and apis.google.com as well as gstatic.com...
I am sure there are many other URLs I need to block to stop google products.

As well as blocking websites I waste time on, or don't like because they track and suggest things to me, I have been trying to make a budget all weekend...
