Today was hot, I watched some videos on youtube as I took care of the kid and one of his friends for the morning.

* [The Sci of Great UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx1tOOc_3fU)
* [Great Impractical Ideas in CS: PowerPoint Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3loq22TxSc)

Then I updated my [xubuntu OS](https://xubuntu.org/) from the Long Term Stable to 19.04. That caused an issue where the lock screen stayed blacked out after I tried to restart it.

I am also writing this to check emoji in the github commit message :)
