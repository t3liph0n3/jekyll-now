Today I have been trying to tweak this [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) blog so that it can have a blog of posts, and a blog of [100 days of code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/r1-log.md).

I see I need to use [Jekyll collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), maybe tomorrow I will look into it more... 

I tried to make a new layout in _layouts, it failed.

I tried to make a category, and it didn't process, and the page I made to pull them was a mess.
