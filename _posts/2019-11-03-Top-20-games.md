# High School (Windows95) #

## SimCity 2000 ##
[play t online](https://playclassic.games/games/city-building-dos-games-online/play-simcity-2000-online/)
I never build an arco, or got a million people in my city. I loved how when I went too far into debt the computer would take over my city too. I first played SimCity when I was in primary school at my uncles house, and it was the first game I purchased for $50 or $60 from Target with a fat book on architecture and lots of other extras.

## Pacific Theatre of Operations II ##
[Snesfun page](http://www.snesfun.com/pacific-theater-of-operations-2)
This and a couple of Civil War games, I use to love to play. I often played as the loosing sides (Confederates, or Japan) and hoped to reorganise the forces to outflank the computer. In PTO you can even avoid going to War with USA for a few more months.
I only ever got a month or two into these games, but the ideas of being able to change history was very exciting to me.

## Birds of Prey ##
[my abandon ware](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/birds-of-prey-1ck)
The best thing about this game was the book of all the specifications of Nato and Soviet systems. I often started on the Nato side, bombed my own carrier then city with a B52 to defect, then get bored and start the game again after loosing a life or two.

## Command and Conquer: Red Alert ##
[play online](https://cncnet.org/red-alert)
I think I never got past the third level on either side. So I have no idea how lots of the units worked etc. But the story, of time travelling and being a military commander inspired lots of creative works I made, from drawings to short stories for English class.

## Pizza Tycoon ##
[website](https://www.pizzatycoon.org/)
This was a favourite in my family. We would usually run a shop for an hour or two, have no idea what to do in the competitions and never be able to break-even and so be turned to doing jobs for the mafia. Good times/

## Final Fantasy VII ##
[Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/39140/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/)
Maybe the first game with a story that intrigued me. I didn't get very far in the game, never explored the over-world or anything.

## Riven ##
[developers page](https://cyan.com/games/riven/)
My uncle had this game, I loved exploring the scenes and imagining how the game would unfold. Didn't get much further than exploring the first 3 or 4 islands.

## Privateer 2: the darkening ##
[gog digital distributor](https://www.gog.com/game/privateer_2_the_darkening)
I wanted to play Privateer, but my computer had a version of DOS that was too new. So I rented this game often and it was fantastic, well balanced flying and an intersting story with Clive Owen as the main character.


## ZZT ##
[museum of zzt](https://museumofzzt.com/)
My friends at High School made a funny game in this, and I never got around to building my own game, but for the past 20 years have been wanting to make a game and always find myself installing DOSbox and playing ZZT.
My friends were more into Ultima (they even gave me a copy of **Ultima: The Savage Empire** [Ultima fandom](https://ultima.fandom.com/wiki/Worlds_of_Ultima:_The_Savage_Empire)) but I couldn't get my head around all the text. I also had a RPG of Lord of the Rings, that again I couldn't figure out. But ZZT was so simple...

# Arcade #

## Dungeons and Dragons: shadow over mystara ##
[Emulatoronline](https://emulatoronline.com/cps2-games/dungeons-dragons-shadow-mystara/)

# Dreamcast #

## Soulcalibur ##
[sega retro](https://segaretro.org/SoulCalibur)
First game where I collected in game art, and first game I grinded in to unlock skins etc.

## Phantasy Star Online ##
[sega retro](https://segaretro.org/Phantasy_Star_Online)
This game opened my imagination, often I would imagine being an interplanetary pioneer visiting a new world to setup the basecamp, or visiting an abandoned settlement. I may had owned the game for months, and not got a character above level 5, but it sparked my imagination.

# Gamecube #

## TimeSplitters 2 ##
[wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters_2)
The first game I played with funny achievements at the end of levels. I would play it on my housemate's Gamecube whilst he was at work.

# Laptop # 

## Photopia ##
[Adam Cadre website](http://www.adamcadre.ac/if.html)
The first interactive fiction game I understood, and was able to complete. I wanted to write my own IF, but wasted lots of time imagining writing IF and reading the documentation.

## Sid Meier's colonization ##
[Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/327400/Sid_Meiers_Colonization_Classic/)
I would name my settlements French words to help me study vocabulary. I never managed to get a victory, but loved how each time I finished I would get an item named after me depending on my score.

## Defcon ##
[Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520/DEFCON/)
For a long time I had a Mac and didn't have many games. This was one exception, I loved that a game was 20-30 minutes long and almost always lost as I couldn't figure our how to convert my SAM sites back from ICBM mode etc.

# Nintendo DS #

## Harvest Moon ##
[fandon page](https://harvestmoon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Games)
I loved whiling away my time trying to build a life for the character. Never was very productive, but did clear lots and get coins for smashing rocks.

## Puyo Puyo ##
[Sega Retro page](https://segaretro.org/Puyo_Pop_Fever)
The story in this game is soo cute, and simple. The gameplay is adictive.

# Steam #

## To the Moon ##
[developers page](https://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/)
Tugging at Heart strings, I love this story and how simple the gameplay was. 

## Disgaea ##
Griding, funny storyline, Japanese voice acting that I have the game set to. I even purchased the DS version so I can get the other endings maybe.


# Smart Phone #

## Gunma's Ambition ##
[google play app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruckygames.gunmaapps&hl=en_US)
It is a time-waster, but fun. I often have no idea what I was doing.
