An idea I had was to make a game for Ghost Jam about a ghost town. A depopulated town, that maybe you get to move to like Harvest Moon with the mission to get the town growing. Or maybe just tell a story about living in a ghost town, i.e. boredom, trying to make a business, having a local government in another town and not dealing with your issues...

Because Ghost Towns already have providence, it is a bit easier to get stories of how things were:
* Maybe new technology has made the town not needed
* or everybody moved away to the city for work
* maybe the town had bad luck, and now no one lives there

I was thinking along the lines of My Neighbor Totoro, or one of the many abandoned Japanese houses I have seen. Some cities like Onomichi have iniatives to try and get young people to move back to the towns and use abandoned houses. There are abandoned towns all over the place, I do not need to make it Japan, but if it was Japan or China I could have a unique architecture and maybe a longer history of the town.

On China, there are old houses with courtyards called Siheyuan. They have buildings usually to the North for the main building, East and West for the children and the South for the servants or something.
Over time the court yards were filled in with temporary structures, and the buildings having narrow streets between them (Hutong?)
