## I need to design something to build soon ##
or I will not be focused, and feel my 100 days of code is just like today.

* At first I wanted to update something.
* Then I read the last part of the [ReactJS tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel)
* I looked at my [Trading Ship game](https://github.com/t3liph0n3/TradingShipGame), and thought of mapping the JavaScript to ReactJS.
* Then I looked up some stuff about Risk management we were discussing in class today
* Before I then clicked through the [ReactJS Support page](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html) and found some Dev pages that looked promising, but were very basic or just questions

## Then I found ##
[dev 39 react questions](https://dev.to/fullstackcafe/39-advanced-react-interview-questions-you-must-clarify-today-3c1h)
what had some interesting pointers about ReactJS.
I read a few of them, then noted it has been an hour.
I haven't actually coded today, but I thought about code & identified I need to set out to build something.
