How-to-write

Today I signed up to [now Novel](https://www.nownovel.com/) to try and get an outline for my game developed. It stopped me after seting out the backstory for my main character - you have to pay $100+ for access :(

I then thought maybe I should have 3 focuses of the story. **Love/Relationship**, **Work/Study** and **Travel/Adventure**

I tried to outline the [7 Act Plot](https://www.keepwriting.com/tsc/magnificent7plotpoints.htm) to each of these three areas in a markdown document. But really I have points I want to touch on in each.

In the **Love/Relationship** I want to touch on how the protagonist wants to have a clique of people to do interesting things. They may find a fun girl who is worried she will teach him bad Japanese because she is from Kansai. "Back Home" he is haunted because after High School he lost contact with everybody.

In **Work/Study** I fleshed out the 7 act plot a bit. The reason the protagonist never went to University is because he wanted to get a job to get enough money to pay for a Dorm for a year, and not be poor at Uni. BUT - it took him almost a year to find a job, by which time he was so depressed he convinced himself he wouldn't want to be a teacher like he initially desired to become. He blames taking so long to find a job, on the Guidance classes at High School only watching early 90s sitcoms about the 70s and 80s.
Similarly he blames not learning a language because he changed classes in Year 7, so started Italian, but then moved to German where he didn't understand anything and failed all the homework - or just copied other people because he got no help, had no text book etc.
The exams and learning Japanese are going to be hard. Because you can not just check to see you have enough stats to pass the exams, you have to ballance the money and burnout.
Get a part time job, find a social life.

**Travel/Adventure** will be things like jogging regularly. Playing team sports and having fun learning and meeting people.
The protagonist had a small taste when he hosted some couch-surfers for a few weeks a year or two ago. He has holidayed for a week or two in Europe when he was 23 and found it a bit daunting. But these were all alone, it ties in with the Love/Relationships.

28, feeling alone and like you have no skills and no job prospects. Hopefully the player can find a way forward for our protagonist. It will be a ballancing act, will passing the N1 make him happy? Or will it just make him realise how little he enjoys speaking Japanese one day. Does he want to work as a Pachinko Technician, or go to university and learn to teach? That is the game. But I have no hard and fast way to write it and plan it.

I recently got stuck on redesigning the opening. I need to make it meaningful, and engaging for the player.
I also have to give the tutorial a voice.
